Automation Components must be registered by using the command:

regsvr32.exe optimal2dx.dll

A message should appear telling you that the registration has succeeded.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note for Windows Win 64bit users: There are 2 regsvr32 applications. One of them is located in System32 folder and the other one is located in Syswow64. Try with the one located in SysWow64 folder.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note for Windows Vista / 7 users: On some builds of Windows Vista the registration fails. Sometimes the message "The module <<optimal2dx.dll>> was loaded but the the call to DllRegisterServer failed with error code 0x8002801c" is displayed. The reason for this message is that some parts of the registry cannot be accessed. 

In some other cases the successful registration message is displayed ... but no registration is actually performed.

To fix these problems you must run the regsvr32 application as an Administrator. You MUST do that even if you are already logged in as Administrator. To do that please follow the steps:

- create a desktop shortcut to application cmd.exe (found in the System32 directory). 
- right-click the shortcut and choose Run As Administrator.
- change the path to the location where the optimal2dx.dll is placed.
- write regsvr32 optimal2dx.dll

If you are not able to Run the Cmd As Administrator you may also create a .bat file containing the command "regsvr32 optimal2dx.dll" and then run that file As Administrator.
